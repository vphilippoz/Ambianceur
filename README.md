# Ambianceur
Raspberry Pi based ambient sound player. Under developpement.


# Goal
I want to make a prototype device that performs the following function :
- When a movement is detected, a music is started. It plays as long as some activity is detected, but at least for 5 minutes.
- At night (between 22:00 and 7:00), no music is played.
- I want to easily be able to change the music (uploading a new file, inserting a usb stick, ...).
- The device is always plugged in and uses wifi to sync its clock (hour minute seconds)
